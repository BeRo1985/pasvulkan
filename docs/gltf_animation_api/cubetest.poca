// This is a simple example of how to use the PasVulkan Scene3D animation API based on the glTF draft extension KHR_animation_pointer in my
// own scripting language with the name POCA which is ECMAScript/JavaScript-like, but which is much more powerful and has a lot of features
// which are not available in JavaScript/ECMAScript, even in the newest version of ECMAScript (ECMAScript 2023).

// This API exists because no real authoring tools for the KHR_animation_pointer draft extension exist yet, so I had to create my own
// authoring way, which is this API. I hope, that the glTF exporter of Blender will support the KHR_animation_pointer extension soon,
// so that people can use Blender to create animations for glTF files with the KHR_animation_pointer extension, but until then, this
// API is the only way to create animations for glTF files with the KHR_animation_pointer extension in a acceptable way for usage
// in combination with PasVulkan.

// Code can be embedded into the glTF files itself in extras fields of any GLTF node, which is compatible with the gltf exporter of Blender,
// since it supports custom properties per node, which are exported as extras fields into glTF files. The code can be embedded as a string or
// as a file, which is relative to the glTF file itself. All code are concatenated together and then executed nearly at the end of the loading
// process of the glTF file. glTF 2.0 JSON example:
// "nodes": [
//   {
//     "name": "myNode",
//     "extras": {
//       "pocacode": "Your code here", (but in a correct JSON string escaped way, of course)
//   or: "pocafile": "yourcodefile.poca", (relative to the gltf/glb file)
//        ...
//     },
//     ...
//   },
//   ...
// ]
//

// At PasVulkan Scene3D each GLTF is an so-named group, which can be instansiated in turn as group instances. Thus, the group instances are
// then the actual scene graph nodes in the overall 3D scene world, which can be transformed, animated, etc. Therefore the naming "Group"
// instead "GLTF" at the API level, since it will no limited to GLTF files only, but also maybe other file formats later, which can be
// loaded into the PasVulkan Scene3D structure.
